Designing for Understanding: Taking a look at UFO sightings in the USA via data visualization.<br>

## Analysis

Utilizing tableau, the analysis team takes a gander at portraying the various UFO sightings from different perspectives. Using different graphs and colors via parsing the data, they visualized how many sightings are seen, what kinds of shapes are seen, and the sightings over the years. Made by Andy Liu, Naman Sahni, and Emma Klein.<br>

## UFO Duration

Made fully on P5JS, the goal for this data visualization was to display a state's average UFO duration. Showing a UFO scrolling across the screen and changing color based on the state being represented, this is a unique take on visualization of time based data. Made by Aylin Martinez.<br>

## UFO Sightings Over Time

Built with p5JS. This data visualization shows the appearance of UFO based on the progression of time. The UFO objects on a black background symbolize sightings in a night sky. This code extracts and combines year, month, and date columns into an array of Date objects, sort the array in ascending order, build an automated date counter, and match the time a UFO is spotted with the time that it is shown on page. By showing the sheer amount of sightings of UFO's, we aim to persuade you on this topic: Aliens **do** exist. Made by Bella Li. <br>

## Space Tourism

Animated fully on P5JS, this experience utilizes SVG maps, sound, and colors to meet a goal: Persuade aliens to come visit the trendiest place in the USA. All code can be found in the 'space tourism' folder in this repo, under sketch.js, style.css, index.html, and vehicle.js. The code parses the data, counting all sightings per state, and asjusting the colors of the states to that ratio accordingly. Made by Sabrina Martinez.<br>
