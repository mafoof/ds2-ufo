Animated fully on P5JS, this experience utilizes SVG maps, sound, and colors to meet a goal: Persuade aliens to come visit the trendiest place in the USA. All code can be found in the 'space tourism' folder in this repo, under sketch.js, style.css, index.html, and vehicle.js. The code parses the data, counting all sightings per state, and asjusting the colors of the states to that ratio accordingly.
