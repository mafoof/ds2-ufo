Designing for Understanding: Taking a look at UFO sightings in the USA via data visualization.<br>

## Analysis

Utilizing tableau, the analysis team takes a gander at portraying the various UFO sightings from different perspectives. Using different graphs and colors via parsing the data, they visualized how many sightings are seen, what kinds of shapes are seen, and the sightings over the years. Made by Andy Liu, Naman Sahni, and Emma Klein.<br>

## UFO Duration

Made fully on P5JS, the goal for this data visualization was to display a state's average UFO duration. Showing a UFO scrolling across the screen and changing color based on the state being represented, this is a unique take on visualization of time based data. Made by Aylin Martinez.<br>

## UFO Sightings Over Time

Using p5js, UFO images are displayed on a black canvas, symbolizing sightings in a night sky. Parsing through dates and the number of sightings, we get to see the sheer amount of sightings of UFO's, leading to us trying to persuade you on this topic: Aliens **do** exist. Made by Bella Li. <br>

## Space Tourism

Animated fully on P5JS, this experience utilizes SVG maps, sound, and colors to meet a goal: Persuade aliens to come visit the trendiest place in the USA. All code can be found in the 'space tourism' folder in this repo, under sketch.js, style.css, index.html, and vehicle.js. The code parses the data, counting all sightings per state, and asjusting the colors of the states to that ratio accordingly. Made by Sabrina Martinez.<br>
